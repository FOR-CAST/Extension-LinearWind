# What is the Linear Wind Extension?

The Linear Wind extension generates linear wind events such as tornadoes and derechos, and is loosely based on the Original Wind extension, primarily differing in the shape of wind events and producing variability in wind speed within wind events. The extension can simulate both derechos and tornadoes in the same time step. Micro-bursts and other wind events that typically produce more circular patterns of disturbance are more simply simulated using the Base Wind extension.
